feat: Integrated video player with display optimization and Qt6 modernization

BREAKING: Eliminated external video player dependencies

🎯 Major Features:
• Self-contained Qt6 multimedia player (QMediaPlayer + QVideoWidget)
• Comprehensive video controls (play/pause/stop/seek/timeline)
• Dynamic mode switching between live preview and video playback
• Professional video display with aspect ratio preservation

📐 Display Enhancements:
• Video widget sizing: 640x360 minimum, 800x450 preferred (16:9)
• Expanded preview area: 800px → 900px for better video display
• Proper size policies and layout integration
• Professional scaling with Qt::KeepAspectRatio

🏗️ Qt6 Modernization:
• Fixed all deprecation warnings with modern API patterns
• Removed manual MOC includes for cleaner builds
• Cross-platform font fallbacks (SF Mono → Consolas → Monaco)
• Synchronized GUI defaults (60fps → 30fps) with encoder

⚡ Performance Optimizations:
• H.264 settings: CRF 23→28, preset medium→fast, bitrate limits
• Audio NaN prevention and buffer clearing
• Expected 50-70% file size reduction
• Faster encoding with maintained quality

🎮 Replay System:
• Auto-discovery of MP4 recordings with smart filtering
• Built-in file browser with video format support
• Real-time playback timeline with seeking
• Recording metadata display (size, timestamp)

Technical: Complete elimination of "taprecord" app usage, modern Qt6 
multimedia integration, professional video display optimization, and 
comprehensive encoding improvements for production-ready game capture.
